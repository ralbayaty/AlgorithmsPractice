## Algorithms Practice

This repository contains several scripts I am using to practice various algorithms in Python, and later in C++. Not
everything listed below has already been coded/included, but will at some point.

# Types:
1) DFS tree traversal (with a unique node variant)
2) BFS tree traversal (with a unique node variant)
3) Fibonacci number generation (recursive, generative, and memoization)
10) Sorting and removing duplicates from lists larger than memory 
4) Hashtables
5) Prime number lists
6) Dynamic Programming (make change problem, others...)
7) A* path planning
8) String Substring Pattern Matching
9) Various others....
